# Airline Passenger Satisfaction ✈

## 1. Business Understanding
This project analyzes feedback from over 120,000 airline passengers, including details about each person, their flight, and type of travel, along with their ratings on things like cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience. Understanding this is crucial for improving airline services, identifying what passengers value most, and making decisions that enhance customer satisfaction and overall travel experience.

### Scenario:
An airline company has been receiving mixed reviews from its passengers. A recent survey revealed that many customers reported dissatisfaction with delays, seat comfort, and in-flight service. 
With increased competition in the airline industry, the company is under pressure to improve its customer satisfaction scores to retain loyal customers and attract new ones. The company’s leadership team wants to develop a new strategy to enhance the overall passenger experience, based on real feedback and data.

### Business Question:
What strategies should the airline company use to improve customer satisfaction, based on passenger feedback and service data?
